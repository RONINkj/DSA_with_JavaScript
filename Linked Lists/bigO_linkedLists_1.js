//Big O of Linked Lists
/*
1-insertion at linked list element at end is O(1) because you just need to change the pointers
2-deletion of linked list element at end is O(n) because you just need to change the pointers and traverse the list
3- insertion at linked list element at beginning is O(1) because you just need to change the pointers
4- deletion of linked list element at beginning is O(1) because you just need to change the pointers
5- insertion at linked list element at middle is O(n) because you just need to change the pointers and traverse the list
6- deletion of linked list element at middle is O(n) because you just need to change the pointers and traverse the list
7- searching in linked list is O(n) because you need to traverse the list
