//Big O O(Log n)- Logarithmic Time Complexity - O(log n) - the number of operations is reduced by a factor of log n with each iteration
/*
Big O Notation: 𝑂(log 𝑛) 
the notation 𝑂(log 𝑛)  represent an algorithm whose runtime grows logarithmically with the size of input .this means that as the 
size increases  ,the number of operations required grows much  slowly compared to linear 𝑂( 𝑛)  or quadratic 𝑂(𝑛^2)  complexities

Understanding 𝑂(log 𝑛 )  Complexity
--Logarithmic time complexity implies that with each step, the input size is reduced by a fraction (commonly half).
--The base of the logarithm is typically 2 (binary logarithm), unless stated otherwise.
--It is much more efficient than linear or quadratic complexity, especially for large inputs.
