//Big O Notation - O(1) - Constant Time Complexity - the number of operations is constant and does not 
// change with the size of the input n .This function has a constant time complexity of O(1) because 
// the number of operations is constant and does not change with the size of the input n
// The function will always return the same value regardless of the size of the input n
// The number of operations is constant and does not change with the size of the input n
function addItems(n){
    return n + n+n; // O(1) - constant time complexity - the number of operations is constant
    //  and does not change with the size of the input n
}
console.log(addItems(10)); // 30

// Big O(1)--it is the most efficient time complexity because the number of operations is
// constant and does not change with the size of the input n
// The function will always return the same value regardless of the size of the input n
// O(1)-- always reffers as "constant time" complexity
