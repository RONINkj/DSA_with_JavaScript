// Big O Notation of array operations
/*
1-Insertion at the end of an array - O(1) - constant time complexity
3-Insertion at the beginning of an array - O(n) - linear time complexity
2-deleteion at the end of an array - O(1) - constant time complexity
4-Deletion at the beginning of an array - O(n) - linear time complexity
5-insertion or deletion in the middle of an array - O(n) - linear time complexity
6- Accessing an element in an array by index - O(1) - constant time complexity
7- searching an element in an array by value - O(n) - linear time complexity

*/
// O(n^2)-- Loop within a loop
// O(n) -- proportional to the size of the input n
// O(log n)-- divide and conquer algorithms
// O(1)-- constant time complexity
